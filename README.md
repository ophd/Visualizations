#Purpose
This repository contains my attempts at creating or recreating interesting data visualizations.

##OECD Life Expectancy
This visualization attempts to recreate the dot plot of the top ten countries by life expectancy at birth that Dark Horse Analytics created in their 2012 blog post [1]. The data for this visualization was found on the oecd website [2].
